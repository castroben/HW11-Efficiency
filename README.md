# Plagiarism-Detector
This is a Java project I built to detect plagiarism on a corpus of documents.

The program reads documents contained in the corpus, creates n-grams of the files' content, and finds the number of n-gram matches between different documents in the corpus. The program return the number of matches between any two documents if that number exceeds a specific threshold. This threshold is set by the user.
